## Image Classification Automation
By Sean Sander

This is a program used to classify objects seen in supplied images in given (or default to the program) directories.

Steps:
1. To use the program, run the C++ program (driver for the OpenCV Python file)
2. Pick to use either the existing folders or add a new directory with your own images
3. Declare the program to search for either faces or stop signs
4. The resulting images will have blue rectangles around where the computer thinks it recognized an object
